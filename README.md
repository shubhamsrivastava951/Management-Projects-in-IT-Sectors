* We have created a website that will resolve the Coal-Ash utilization problem by using an AI algorithm.
* We have created a platform where the consumer and the producer could meet up, and provide information regarding availability, strength, price and can initiate the business.
* We are going to create an online platform where the consumer can check the compressive strength of the coal ash and the kind of coal ash required.

# [2. IT Service Management](https://github.com/shubhamsrivastava951/Management-Projects-in-IT-Sectors/blob/main/IT%20Service%20Management.pdf)

* This Report was to provide the solution for RADBANK. RADBANK is an Australian bank that provides Retail Banking, Lending, Wealth Man
agreement and Mobile Banking services to its 16 million customers.
* However, recently their business value (in the form of profits) has not increased as much as the Bank would like.
* A recent review of RADBANK therefore has recommended the Bank to improve its efficiency (lower cost) and effectiveness (achieve the
desired business outcomes) of its IT services.
* Hence, this is now one of the Bank’s specific goals, which we have tried to accomplish through Outsourcing(Cloud Computing) and IT Service Management.

* we had identified the reasons for their downfall which was completely based on the stakeholders' needs and requirements.
