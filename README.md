* we have created a website that will resolve the Coal-Ash utilization’s problem by using an AI algorithm.
* Basically, we have created a platform where the consumer and the producer could meet up, and provide information regarding availability, strength, price and can initiate the business.
* We are going to create an online platform where the consumer can check the compressive strength of the Coal-ash and the kind of coal ash required.

# [2. IT Service Management](https://github.com/shubhamsrivastava951/Management-Projects-in-IT-Sectors/blob/main/IT%20Service%20Management.pdf)

* This Report was to provide the solution for RADBANK. RADBANK is an Australian bank that provides Retail Banking, Lending, Wealth Man
agement and Mobile Banking services to its 16 million customers.
* However, recently their business value (in the form of profits) has not increased as much as the Bank would like.
* A recent review of RADBANK therefore has recommended the Bank to improve the efficiency (lower cost) and effectiveness (achieve the
desired business outcomes) of its IT services.
* Hence, this is now one of the Bank’s specific goals, which we had tried to accomplish through Outsourcing(Cloud Computing) and IT Service Management.

# [5. Smart trolley](https://github.com/shubhamsrivastava951/Management-Projects-in-IT-Sectors/blob/main/Smart%20Trolley.pdf)

* In light of the increasing use and ongoing prominence and pervasiveness of technology in the current social environment, the use of AI or applications of data analytics in seemingly mundane yet economically beneficial in transactional situations have become increasingly in demand across various industries and markets. The need for an effective and unobstructive system to streamline transactions—especially those that involve daily shopping and retail transactions, has seen unprecedented gain in recent years. 

* Our venture is planned to provide new features and functionalities to the interconnected shopping scene in the form of a recommendation system, trolley-integrated contactless payment, and the ability for shopping trolleys to automatically scan multiple goods once it has been put in the trolley cart. Smart Trolley would attempt to cover functions & address issues such as keeping total expenses on track, painstaking queues at billing counters, shoplifting, invalid or insufficient payment, etc. The project utilises technological applications that allows the team to transform the retail industry, which, in recent times, has relied on technological innovation for success
